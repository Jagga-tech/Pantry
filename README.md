Pantrypal - Your Smart Kitchen Companion 🍳

Hey there! Welcome to Pantrypal. Let me tell you what this app is all about.


 What is Pantrypal?

You know that feeling when you open your fridge and think "I have no idea what to cook"? Or when you find that tomato that's been hiding in the back for way too long? Yeah, we've all been there.

**Pantrypal helps you:**
- Find recipes based on what you actually have at home
- Stop wasting food
- Get reminders before ingredients expire
- Plan your meals for the week

Think of it as having a smart friend who knows exactly what's in your kitchen and suggests delicious meals you can make right now.
